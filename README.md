Writing my own YNAB so I don't need to pay subscription.
Using Kotlin with Room.


Ready features include:
- Simple register and login with Room
- Splash(Loading) screen to load user data/generate new user data
- Settings page with delete account button (to clean up accounts if I do too much testing)
- Top app bar and bottom navigation bar
- Accounts page for bank accounts, with add/delete/update account functionality
- Add Transaction page
- Transactions page under accounts for transactions per account and all transactions
- Transaction page under transactions with transaction details. Allow update and delete transaction


Planned features include
1.  Budget page with top bar month scroller, with updates from transactions, and ability to assign surplus income (default to only 1 budget).
2.  Budget Item page with budget item details.
3.  Goal page to set goal per budget item, with change reflected across relevant budget items across months. (Goal should be decoupled from budget item)


Far-future features include:
- Enhance Transactions page under accounts with delete/filter/sort transactions functionality
- Enhance splash screen to include a simple walkthrough on how to use the app
- Cloud storage (maybe Firebase if webage friendly)
- Webpage
